These are projects that I have completed throughout my masters
The following are projects that I have completed and its description.

1) Website creation
Involves HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the purpose of practice. This website has yet to be published but it has been completed for submission.
It is a fictional resort themed website that conforms to the design principle taught throughout the semester.

2) Pokemon themed minesweeper 
Used Python along with additional libraries to create a minesweeper game that has pokemon as its theme.
Users will be able to keep track of their score, save their game, load a different game, change the difficulty of the game and switch between different versions of the game 
(changes the look of the game and excludes some of the functionalities that comes with the game)

3) Cloud Computing Project
Performed analysis on dataset acquired from Kaggle and stored dataset with the use of distributed file system (Apache Hadoop). Processing was achieved with the help of Spark clusters and Spark programming techniques and Spark built-in libraries. Finally, all results were then visualized with the use of Jupyter Notebook and is deployed with the use of Google Cloud Computing (GCP).
