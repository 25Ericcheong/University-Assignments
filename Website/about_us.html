          <h3>The Tale of Volca-everest</h3>
          <p>With 2 brothers determined to produce the ultimate resort that encompasses nature and thrill together, as one. This is the beginning of the origins of Volcaeverest</p>
        </article>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>The Beginning</h3>
        <article class="the_beginning">
          <h4>1970</h4>
          <iframe data-scroll-class="image-sliding" class="image-slide" width="100%" height="500" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UqIz8f7EcMk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen alt="Volcanic eruption that amazed both of the founders of Volcaeverest"></iframe>
          <p>The 2 brothers began their adventure as they hike moutains from Mount Everest, Pikes Peak to Mount Fuji. However, their adventure had to be put on hold as a mountain that they intended to climb was about to erupt. The video shown below was an eruption that occured right in front of their very eyes and they could not do anything but be mesmerized. Although some eruptions could either last for a day or even thousands of years (Simkin & Siebert, 1994), this one in particular lasted for at least 10 years. </p>
          <br>
          <p>They were so amazed by this phenomenon that they decided to put their adventure on hold. So, they found a spot with the perfect view and observed the process of magma flowing and even recorded as you can see based on the video above. The brothers then thought - to experience this for only 2 days was not going to be sufficient and so they came up with an idea almost in parallel to build a resort on the very tip of the mountain. A crazy yet amazing idea, to be close to nature and always remember to fear it. An idea, that became a reality a few decades down the road.</p>
        </article>
        <article class="the_beginning_part2">
          <h4>1980</h4>
          <figure data-scroll-class="image-sliding" class="image-slide"><img src="images/volcano-about-us-story-1.jpg" alt="The stabilize volcanic mountain after 10 years for which the 2 owwners came back to build Volcaeverest"></figure>
          <p>For 10 years they waited for the volcanic mountain to stabilize (Scholastic, n.d.), they could not stop thinking about the amazing eruption that occured before their very eyes. They decided that they were going to open a resort on that very mountain they saw erupting. Many laughed and thought they were joking but nobody understood the love they had for nature and how passionate they are in wanting everyone to feel the same as them.</p>
          <br>
          <p>To properly embrace the volcanic lifestyle that they envision their resort to have, they named activities and rooms after the volcano. The bungee magma jumping was something both of them had tried and loved as that literally and physically brought them closer to the volcano's core. They wanted the resort to be thrilled centred and still nature loving so, they decided that this resort will cater to such group of people.</p>

        <article class="the_beginning_part3">
          <h4>1990</h4>
          <figure data-scroll-class="image-sliding" class="image-slide"><img src="images/volcano-about-us-image1.jpg" alt="The setbacks the owners had to go through during the building process "></figure>
          <p>Although the brothers had ideas that nobody had ever thought, they were very well prepared in terms of equipments that ensured the safetiness of the activities. However, nobody would have been prepared by the power of mother nature. With the first and second eruption phase over (The Strait Times, 2017), the brothers commenced the construction of Volcaeverest! But during this process, they were met tsunamis, unexpected magma explosion, earthquakes, etc.(ITIC, n.d.)</p>
          <br>
          <p>The brothers had many road bumps that caused the opening of Volcaeverest to be delayed but they did not stop to think about giving up because all they could ever think of is the sight of an eruption and wanting to share that experience with everyone. They were expecting unusual events to happen since they know that this idea is crazy on its own. It was a mission to prove that they could bring their idea into reality and let others be more appreciative of nature.</p>

          <h4>2000</h4>
          <figure data-scroll-class="image-sliding" class="image-slide"><img src="images/volcano-home-background.jpg" alt="The final stages of the building process of Volcaeverest - you can see a resort on the top of the mountain"></figure>
          <p>With that dream that they share nothing was going to stop them from achieving their perfect nature resort dream. They pushed on and finally, in the year 2000, Volcaeverest was launched. With tourism blooming and multiple transportation available to get to the resort, the brothers were looking forward to the growth of Volcaeverest. Due to the position of the resort, they were able to fully capitalize activities such as quad biking, volcano boarding. Also, the volcano allowed them to be self sufficient as well (Brady, 2018). This allowed them to be creative with the room production as well and one of the most famous rooms that we have currently is due to that fact. The room is called Magmatastic.</p>

          <h3>The Present</h3>
          <p>Fastforward to 2020, we remain as one of the most unique one of a kind spot to visit. Not because of the fact that the resort is placed on a mountain that could someday erupt once again but the utilization of maximum exposure to nature is what attracts customers. Apart from the thrilling activities and exotic rooms, the brothers believe that they were able to build a resort that they have always dreamt of and are satisfied because they can share this dream of their's with everyone else in the world. Whether you like heat, rocks or heart pumping activities - Volcaeverest is the place you want to be. Seeing it is very different from experiencing it first hand.</p>
